    <h1>Cities I've Lived In:</h1>
    <p>This one's a little bit boring, because I've just never moved. Hopefully that will change soon though.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fort Collins, CO</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Cities I'd Like to Visit:</h1>
    <p>I've visited plenty of cities in China, but I've never been to Japan, and I feel like it goes without saying, but that place just looks surreal. Other than that, I've never been to Europe or Australia, and I think London and Sydney would each be fun to visit.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong></li>

      <li><em>London, England</em></li>

      <li><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong></li>
